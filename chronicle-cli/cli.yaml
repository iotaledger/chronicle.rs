                    Specify that you do not want to backup logs as they are merged. This is potentially dangerous but
                    reduces disk usage.

                    Specify that the merge should continue even if a file is deemed to be invalid. Depending on the
                    validation level, this could happen in the middle of merging a file. In this event, the consumed
                    file will be renamed .err but remain untouched, but milestones from that file will stay merged.

                      - Light: Will perform partial deserialization of each milestone, checking only that
                          the index is valid

                          each file. This will avoid merging the entire invalid file.
                      - JustInTime: Will perform full deserialization of each milestone as they are merged.
                          This will avoid merging invalid lines but may partially merge invalid files.

                    Include finalized logs (logs which have reached their maximum size) in the merge.
                    This will not include .err files.

              Validate log files without modifying them. This will perform various checks and output any issues
              as well as whether or not they can be handled by the merge process.
